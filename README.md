# QREM
This repository contains the code to diagonalize the quantum random energy model (QREM) with a random field. The code uses the SLEPc library in C programming language to exactly diagonalize the Hamiltonian at a preferred energy in the spectrum. The code has been used for the work in done in the following paper:
